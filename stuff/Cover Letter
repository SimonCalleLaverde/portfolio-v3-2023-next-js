Hello, I studied "Web Design & Design for Mobile Devices" 9 years ago after graduating as a creative "Publicist".

I then worked for an Australian digital agency for over 4 years where I started with my basic knowledge in UI Design, my knowledge in Responsive Design, and bases of coding; my primarily role became "Lead Developer" for years, although my main skill is to be able to design "Responsive User Interfaces" and understand the challenges, changes, and iterations between versions and devices, from design to code.

I started my journey to be able to bring awesome digital experiences to life, I then improved my knowledge in "Front-end" for 5 years, I then improved my "UI Design" skills and "Web Best Practices" for other 2 years while freelancing, doing SEO, social media, and even some print projects.

I took an in-person course in "Product Design including UX and UI" in London, UK, in 2022-2023 and now I would like to join a company team once again to help on big projects for thousands or millions of users once again.
