Hello, I studied "Web Design & Design for Mobile Devices" 9 years ago after graduating as a creative "Publicist".

I then worked for an Australian digital agency for over 4 years where I started with my basic knowledge in UI Design, my knowledge in Responsive Design, and bases of coding; my primarily role became "Lead Developer" for years, although my main skill is to be able to design or develop "Responsive User Interfaces" understanding the real challenges, differences, and iterations between versions and devices, from design to code.

I started my journey in the industry to be able to bring awesome digital experiences to life, I then improved my knowledge in "Front-end" for 5 years, then I improved my "UI Design" skills and "Web Best Practices" even more for other 2 years while freelancing, doing SEO, social media, and more as well.

I recently took an in-person course in "Product Design including UX and UI" at Experience Haus, London, UK, in 2022-2023 and now I would like to join a company and team once again to help on big projects once again.
