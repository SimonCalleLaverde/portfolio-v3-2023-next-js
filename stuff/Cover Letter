Hello, my journey started after taking a university course in "Web Design & Design for Mobile Devices" 9 years ago, after graduating as a creative "Publicist".

I then worked for an Australian digital agency for over 4 years where I started with my basic knowledge in UI Design, Responsive Design, and bases of coding; my primarily role became "Lead Developer" for years, although my main skill is to be able to design or develop responsive user interfaces understanding the real challenges, the differences, and iterations between versions and the different devices, from design to code.

I recently took an in-person course in "Product Design including UX and UI" at Experience Haus, London, UK, in 2022 - 2023. Now I'm willing to join a team to help them bring and create big projects once again.

I helped bring to life dozens of website/app related projects most related to environmental and political issues. I made the mobile/tablet iterations of all of them as well, as I had responsive design knowledge and skills. I took a course in "Web Design & Design for Mobile Devices" 9 years ago.

Mostly, I helped my previous company (Code Nation Australia) to grow from the very beginnings, being part of many of the initial big decisions that shaped this digital agency and its culture.
