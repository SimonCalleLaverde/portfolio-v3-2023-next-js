Hi there, I live in the beautiful country of Colombia which I have shown in some photos throughout my portfolio. I have a career in marketing and advertising and over 6 years of experience in web development. I worked over 4 years of that time for an international agency and clients around the world. {/*We started working in a physical environment, the company then moved to a remote setting in the last two and a half years that I worked there.*/}

I started my journey after graduating with a bachelor's degree as a <em className="font-ultra-light text-italic">Publicist</em> {/*with studies in marketing and advertising */}in the <a href="https://www.utadeo.edu.co/es" target="blank">Universidad&nbsp;Jorge&nbsp;Tadeo&nbsp;Lozano</a>. I wanted to apply my 5 years long career knowledge through digital platforms so I then took a continuing education program course in <em className="font-ultra-light text-italic">Web Design and Design for Mobile Devices</em> in a recognized university here in my country, the <a href="https://www.javeriana.edu.co/home" target="blank">Pontificia&nbsp;Universidad&nbsp;Javeriana</a>.

I then worked for over 4 years with the great team of <a href="https://www.codenation.com/" target="blank">Code&nbsp;Nation</a>, a 5 star rated international{/* company*/} digital agency based in Australia. There, we created dozens of robust and powerful campaign websites and platforms for both progressive and big organizations. {/*we had a couple of occations  where all the team could get together.*/}

In the past couple of years I have been learning much more about UI design, UX research and strategy, web best practices, and enhancing my design and coding skills alike. <a href="/projects">Read&nbsp;&&nbsp;see&nbsp;more.</a>
