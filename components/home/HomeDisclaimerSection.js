                In the meantime, you can check out my previous Portfolio (V2){/*II*/} 2021 for more <Link href="https://simoncallelaverde.github.io/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>about me</em></Link>, or so that you can take a peek at
                what I&apos;ve done before and at {/*some*/}big part of the digital <Link href="https://simoncallelaverde.github.io/projects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>projects</em></Link> I&apos;ve been a part of. There I have a bunch (28)
                Front-end Development projects I helped build for an Australian-based digital agency, and {/*2*/}a couple independent User Interfase (UI) Design projects I designed and developed myself.
              </p>

              <p>
                Although this is only a rough first version of it, this new Portfolio (V3) 2023 is currently being made with better technologies (i.e. ReactJS / NextJS) and will have the option to display better case studies. It also currently shows my
                latest real client Product Design & User Experience (UX) project that I worked in a <Link href="https://experiencehaus.com/courses/product-design-inc-ux-ui/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em><strong>Product Design inc. UX & UI.</strong></em></Link> course
                that I was taking in 2022 - 2023 in London, UK.
              </p>

              {/*<p>
                I took a while learning new tech and re-building this simpler but more to the point Portfolio, organizing my new most recent case study and others to come soon, so now I really
                want to start applying to jobs and put a first MVP version in the wild while I polish it and add to it over time.
