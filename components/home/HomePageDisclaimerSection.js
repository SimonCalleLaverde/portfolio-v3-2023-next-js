              I graduated from university as a creative <em>Publicist (2013)</em> and I became a <em>Web Designer (2013)</em> in a separate continuing education university course, learning from professionals to properly design for all rising devices{/*, not just shrinking things in smaller screens like some do,*/} where we studied tens of amazing responsive UI designs.
            </p>

            <p className="d-none">
              I learned some HTML, CSS, and JS and I was then gradually made <em>Front-end Developer (2014)</em> as I felt in love with coding my own projects and ideas.

            <p className="d-none">
              I then worked <em>hybrid and finally remotely for an international digital agency based in Melbourne, Australia, for over 4 years (2015-2019)</em> helping them bring digital experiences to life as well as creating the mobile, tablet, and the iterations for {/*the */}different devices. I also sometimes had meetings with the clients or their team, had consultations, or had to align expectations between design and development, specially with {/*some */}clients that were in my time-zone{/* where we could speak directly*/}, to help guide the final project changes or feature additions towards a functional UI including most of the final client&apos;s needs and feedback changes. I also learned to develop and design for accesibility, with real scenarios and different requirements.
            </p>

            <p className="d-none">
              I was then more officially made <em>UI Designer (since 2019)</em> working in some freelance projects and creating some designs. I studied UI design and all types of web best practices for 2 years, working also in some SEO and some social-media projects.

              Finally made <em>UX Designer (since 2022-2023)</em> when I travelled to London, UK, to enrol in an in-person course taken at Experience Haus, where I collaborated with real teammates, working for individual real clients, in a dynamic agency-type environment.
