            {/*
            - I gained over 4 years of experience working at a digital agency based in Melbourne, Australia, that had incredibly high impact on environmental and political issues
            - Interaction Design / Interactive Design
            */}

            <p>
              I graduated from university as a creative <em>Publicist (2013)</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              I was then made <em>Responsive Web Designer (2013)</em> in a separate university course, learning from professionals to properly design for all devices. {/*, not just shrinking things in smaller screens like some do, w*/}We studied tens of amazing responsive UI designs.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then made self-taught <em>Front-end Developer (2014)</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              I then <em>worked hybrid and finally remotely for an international digital agency based in Melbourne, Australia, for over 4 years (2015-2019)</em> bringing digital experiences to life as well as creating the mobile, tablet, and the iterations for {/*the */}different devices. I also sometimes had to have meetings with the clients or the team, had consultations, and align expectations between design and development specially with {/*some */}clients that were in my time-zone where we could speak directly, to help guide the final project changes or feature additions towards a functional UI including most of the final client&apos;s needs and feedback changes.
            </p>

            <p>
              I was then made <em>UI Designer (since 2019)</em> working in some freelance projects and creating some designs. Studying UI design and all best practices for 2 years, working also in SEO, and some social-media.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally made <em>UX Designer (since 2022-2023)</em> when I travelled to London, UK, to enrol in an in-person course taken at Experience Haus, where I collaborated with real teammates, for individual real clients, in a dynamic agency-type environment.
            </p>

            {/*<p>
              I have also worked in print and some graphic design. I also worked through Amazon FBA in 2020-2021, but that&apos;s another story. I&apos;m now willing to re-enter the work forces and join another team to help with UI, UX, and Digital Product designs.
